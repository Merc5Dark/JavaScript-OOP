// DON'T MODIFY OBJECTS YOU DON'T OWN
// DON'T OVERWRITE, ADD OR REMOVE EXISTING METHODS IN THE BUILT IN OBJECTS
// Some framework might have used that method already, in future versions of JavaScript, that method might be added to the built in methods.
// To play safe and avoid unnessesary bugs, avoid modifying built in objects.
